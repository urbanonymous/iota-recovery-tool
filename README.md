# iota-recovery-tool
Recovers the correct IOTA seed from a wrong copied one. Takes some time...

# How to use
Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run it with `python iota_recovery.py`

Then set the target address. Ex: `MXJBHQOCOPWUWGKE9ZMYUDPUHTRHORJAFTMXKAHSXZ9BDHKBZNNVVZQHXNLLDUXTFOAQOYNEUQCAOFQA`
And finally select the number of addresses that you want to check for each variation of the seed. Ex: `10`

That's it, all you need now is to wait.

Increase the number of addresses for each seed variation if you don't find the correct one, but have in mind that this increases the time taken.
