# ry-iota-recovery
Recovers the correct IOTA seed from a wrong copied one. Takes some time...

# How to use
Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run it with `python iota_recovery.py`

Then set the target address. Ex: `MXJBHQOCOPWUWGKE9ZMYUDPUKLKICORJAFTMXKAHSXZ9BDHKBZNNVVZQHXNLLDUXTFOAQOYNEUQCAOFQA`
And finally select the number of addresses that you want to check for each variation of the seed. Ex: `10`

That's all, now you need to wait.
